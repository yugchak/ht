<p class="main_p">I have been working remotely every day from a hotel cafe this week and had daily video calls. 3 out of the 5 groups of people I had calls with asked: “Is there a man near you talking at the top of his lungs? Cause I am literally only hearing him.” And the answer was yes, almost always. (These men were also working remotely on their laptops)</p>
